pixelsorter (+ cli) written in golang  
used my (node)js implementation as reference, which uses [satyarth/pixelsort](https://github.com/satyarth/pixelsort/) as reference  
not at parity; no rotation, proper randomness isnt implemented (too lazy tbh), no sorter/comparator validation  
first time usin go, this is prolly super cursed  
it go nyoom tho :3
